# QemuScripts
Scripts for quickly setting up QEMU Virtual Machines on Linux

## install-windows.sh
This script tries to make installing Windows in QEMU easier by figuring out things like which ISOs to mount, creating a Disk Image and setting up VNC with the correct keymap.
It also looks for and automatically mounts an unattend.iso from https://schneegans.de/windows/unattend-generator/
